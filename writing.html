   <h4> Do a quick outline. Don't waste your time trying to cram everything into outline. Write down important things then move on.</h4>

   <hr class="my-4">

   <h4>Find evidence that you need because that will back up what you're saying. The right evidence helps make your evidence become strong.</h4>
   <hr class="my-4">

   <h4> Write about what you have an idea on. It's better to write out your thoughts so that you don't forget. Also, write about things that you know because it'll be simpler for you.</h4>
 
  <hr class="my-4">
   
   <h4> Pay attention to key words because that will be an advantage for your writing. </h4>
  
 <hr class="my-4">
   
   <h4> In timed writing, KEEP THINGS SHORT AND SIMPLE. Don't overcomplicate your life  by writing varied syntax. Stay safe and keep things short and simple, but that doesn't mean to not expalin. Have your explainations be straight forward.</h4>
